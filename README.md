# Chime
Chime, as spun up in the Forest, Kiwiburn 2016. Here, [watch this](https://vimeo.com/176573373) to get the idea...

# Some actual technology
Chime includes:
  * The sounds module - plays a number of wave files precisely in sync
  * The launchpad module - interacts with a Novation LaunchStation through USB midi. Here it has the moving line and toggle buttons but obviously butchering out the useful bits is throughly doable.
  * A data model, the primary interface to the internal state of the LaunchStation (use whatever.leds)
